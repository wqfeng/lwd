            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique called <i><dfn>sous vide</dfn></i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <citte>Cooking for Geeks</citte>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

            <p><strong>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</strong></p>
